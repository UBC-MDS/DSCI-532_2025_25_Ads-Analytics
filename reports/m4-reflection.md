# Dashboard Progress Reflection (Post-Milestone 3)

## 1. Implemented Parts Since Milestone 3
- Improved performance by (1) converting data to binary (2) fixing slow callbacks, (3) removing unnecessary columns, and (4) cleaning up and refactoring src codes.
- Fixed the issue where "All" is not cleared when selecting specific options in filter
- Added favicon, tab title, and footer.
- Visual improvents: (1) make filter widget stretch to the bottom of the page, (2) adjust x axis, (3) show "no data" when no filter is selected.


## 2. Parts Not Yet Implemented


## 3. Differences from Proposal/Sketch
In our proposal, we initially included basic visualizations such as density plots and histograms. However, in the final dashboard, we incorporated more advanced charts, including word clouds, box plots, pie charts, scatter plots, and bar charts. This deviation from our original plan allowed us to provide a more comprehensive and in-depth visual analysis of various apps and categories in the Google Play Store.

## 4. Corner Cases or Unresolved Issues
- Filters are still not working on render.com (out of memory error)

## 5. Deviation from Best Practices (if applicable)

## 6. Reflection on the Dashboard


### What the Dashboard Does Well:
- Easy to navigate

### Limitations or Areas for Improvement:
- Troubleshooting render deployment proved abotive, hence we still have soe unresponsive charts when deployed

### Potential Future Improvements or Additions:
- Deploy to another host service
