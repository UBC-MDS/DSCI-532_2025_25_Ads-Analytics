## Motivation and Purpose of the Project

Advertisement companies face the challenge of sifting through large amounts of app data to determine which apps offer the best potential for advertising based on user engagement, ratings, and other metrics. If we could understand the factors that lead to higher sales and ratings, it may be possible to focus development resources to improve sales outcomes. 

To address this challenge, we propose building a data visualization app that allows the advertisement company to identify the most promising apps to target for ad placements. Solving this problem is crucial because effective ad targeting can significantly boost campaign performance and ROI. 

This dashboard will simplify decision-making by offering a clear, interactive interface to visualize key app metrics, helping the team identify high-potential apps quickly and make data-driven advertising decisions.

# Description of the data
We are using the [Google Play Store Apps](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps) dataset, which includes features related to apps on the Google Play Store, such as app names, categories, ratings, and more. Our dataset consists of information on 9,660 apps, each with 9 different features. We aim to leverage these features to analyze how different factors impact ratings and installs, ultimately helping to make more informed advertising decisions.
